# Definitions

> A knowledge base is a central digital library full of information that allows customers the ability to find out information about using your products and services or what your organization does as a whole. A knowledge base provides your customers with access to important information 24/7, eases the workload of your customer support teams, and allows your customers to self-service.

> A knowledge base is a self-serve customer service library that includes information about a product, service, or topic. They usually look something like this.

# Typical content

> Most knowledge bases include information about how to get started with a new product, in-depth information about using advanced features, and answers to common problems and issues

[@giles10BestKnowledge2020]

# Recurrent topics

- When does my order ship?
- How long will it take to get my order?
- How can I cancel my subscription?
- How do I enter a promo code?

- When do you charge my card?
- How long does my trial last?
- How can I get in contact with support?

# Best Practices

> A knowledge base doesn’t simply have to be a reservoir of help center articles. It can also include functions like a frequently-asked questions (FAQ) section, a user forum, articles, white papers, how-to articles, video tutorials, case studies, and dictionaries or glossaries — essentially, anything that helps customers understand and use your products or services.

[@giles10BestKnowledge2020]

> Any given product-based help article is high quality, and it includes a variety of teaching styles

Example: [Free SEO Learning Center - Moz](https://moz.com/learn/seo "Learn SEO — Free SEO Learning Center [2020] - Moz")

> building a knowledge base doesn’t ensure it will actually be successful (or even useful for that matter). First, the customer has to actually be able to find answers to their questions. This brings user experience, design, architecture, and even SEO into the mix.

# Planning a knowledge base

- Look for trends
- Find bottlenecks with tools like HotJar and Usabilla
- Branding
- Styleguide
- Accessibility standards

---

> We specifically focus on data from support emails that present self-service opportunities—common themes that can be answered in only 1 or 2 replies from our customer support team. If a question can be answered efficiently over email, it can likely be solved by self-service content, which means we can make a measurable impact with content improvements in our help center.

# Maintaining a knowledge base

# Writing for a knowledge base

# Linking from other content

> For example, if you're writing a blog post and reference your relevant feature [...], consider linking to a knowledge base [...] versus the product page. Not only does it provide a more in-depth explanation of the feature, but it also showcases your product in action for those readers who may not (yet) be customers.


# Software

 - Open Source or proprietary?
 - Prize
 - Forum or community features?
 - Appropriate analytics?
 - Support for this software?
 - Integration with other tools

# Problems

# Content vs. Knowledge?


# DITA and Knowledge Bases

> So, can we get DITA into a knowledge base? The answer is yes. Think about KB article: this is more or less compatible with a DITA topic structure. Knowledge base articles usually have specific metadata. The sticking points:

>    Where do you do updates?
>    How do you connect DITA content to the knowledge base database?

---

> Several CCMS (including AEM) have connectors for KB systems such as Salesforce, Zendesk, etc. Yet, the above question of where do you do the updates still stands. Also, who owns the articles? How do you handle conflicts?
